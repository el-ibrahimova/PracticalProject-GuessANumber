This is a simple console game "Guess A Number"
The computer thinks of an integer within a range of 1 to 100. 
The player tries to guess the number. If the guess is incorrect, then the computer tells the player whether the guess was too high or too low. Eventually, the player guesses the correct number.
The key strategy in this game is to generate a clever guess. If, for example, the player knows the number is between 0 and 100, then a reasonable first guess is 50. This choice evenly splits the range, giving you the maximum amount of information about the next guess. If the computer player says the guess is too low, then the second player splits the reduced range and guesses 75. If the player says the guess is too high, then the optimal guess is 25.
